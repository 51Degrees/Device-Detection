Changes in 3.2.1.6:

To reflect changes to the underlying C API the following modifications were 
applied to the PHP C Extension API:

1. Worksets are no longer directly created from the dataset structure. Instead 
a pool of the worksets is created on module load event and for each request a 
workset is retrieved from the pool. The workset is then released back into the 
pool when the request expires/terminates.
2. C API now implements cache. Cache is also initialised when the module is 
loaded.
3. A new function 'fiftyone_match' has been added that makes use of the pool 
of worksets. If should be used instead of the 'fiftyone_degrees_get_properties' 
function.
4. A new function 'fiftyone_match_with_headers' was added that takes a string 
of header:value pairs where each line is separated by a new line character '\n'.
5. A new function 'fiftyone_info' was added to the API to print information 
about the data file currently used.
6. Functions are now better commented and the dataset initialisation check 
logic was moved into a separate function.
