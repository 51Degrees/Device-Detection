------51Degrees Nginx Module------
----------------------------------

[Introduction]
The 51Degrees Nginx module can be used to detect many
properties of the device accessing your site and add
the requested properties to the request as headers.
For example, if the property you want to know is the
browser being used, you would set it with
	51D_properties BrowserName
and when a request is forwarded to your site, it will
have a header like
	HTTP_FIFTYONEDEGREES_BROWSERNAME = Firefox
added.

This module is in a testing phase, to quickly view the
TODO's in the module code, run:
	grep "TODO" 51Degrees_module/ngx_http_51D_module.c
from this directory.

[Installation]
To install, first run:
	./bootstrap
to download Nginx, set the install location to within this
folder and do various other pre-install actions.
Then run:
	./compile
to install Nginx and the 51Degrees module to a new sub-folder
named 'build'.

[Configuration]
The module will run with the settings as they are in
nginx.conf, but you may wish to change them to better fit
your needs (particularly the properties list).
The available settings are:
	51D_filePath -string, path to 51D data file.
	51D_properties -comma separated string,
	                properties to return.
	51D_cacheSize -int, size of 51D workset cache.
	51D_poolSize -int, size of 51D workset pool.

[PHP Page]
If you want to easily test the output from this, copy 'page.php'
to your Apache folder (probably '/var/www/html') and restart
Apache with:
	sudo service restart apache2

[Usage]
To start up nginx from this directory, run:
	./start
This will stop and Nginx process currently running and start
an Nginx proxy server at localhost:8888. Then if you access
	localhost:8888/page.php
from a browser, you will see a list of properties for your
device (These properties can be added or removed in
'nginx.conf').
