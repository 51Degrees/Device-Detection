<tutorial>
Reload from file example that shows how to:
<ol>
	<li>Only maintain a reference to the fiftyoneDegreesWorksetPool and use the
	reference to access dataset and cache.
	<li>Use the fiftyoneDegreesDatasetReloadFromFile function to reload the
	dataset, cache and workset pool from the same location and with the same
	set of properties.
	<li>Retrieve a workset from the pool and return it back into the pool when
	done with detecting current User-Agent.
	<li>Use the reload functionality in a single threaded environment.
	<li>Use the reload functionality in a multi threaded environment.
</ol>
<p>
	This example illustrates how to use a single reference to the provider 
	structure to use device detection and invoke the reload functionality 
	instead of maintaining a reference to the dataset, pool and cache 
	structures separately.
	<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
	fiftyoneDegreesProvider provider;
	</pre></p>
</p>
<p>
	Example assumes that the initial pool, dataset and cache were created using
	either the fiftyoneDegreesInitProviderWithPropertyString function,
	or the fiftyoneDegreesInitProviderWithPropertyArray function.
</p>
<p>
	The fiftyoneDegreesProviderReloadFromFile function requires an existing 
	pool with the initialized dataset and cache. Function reloads the dataset 
	from the same location and with the same parameters as the original dataset. 
	New cache and pool is created.
</p>
<p>
	Please keep in mind that even if the current dataset was constructed with
	all available properties this does not guarantee that the new dataset will
	be initialized with the same set of properties. If the new data file
	contains properties that were not part of the original data file, the new
	extra property(ies) will not be initialized. If the new data file does not
	contain one or more property that were previously available, then these
	property(ies) will not be initialized.
</p>
<p>
	Each successful data file reload should be accompanied by the integrity
	check to verify that the properties you want have indeed been loaded. This
	can be achieved by simply comparing the number of properties before and
	after the reload as the number can not go up but it can go down.
</p>
<p>
	Example also demonstrates the concept of a workset pool. A workset pool is
	a thread safe collection of workset structures. To retrieve a workset use:
	<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
	fiftyoneDegreesWorkset *ws = NULL;
	fiftyoneDegreesProviderWorksetGet(&provider);
	</pre></p>
	And to return a workset to the pool use:
	<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
	fiftyoneDegreesWorksetRelease(ws);
	</pre></p>
</p>
<p>
	The benefit of the workset pool is that it eliminates the overheads of
	creating a new workset structure for every new request, instead an existing
	workset is used. Be sure to initialize the workset of the appropriate size
	as an insufficiently small workset could cause delay with processing the
	device detection requests as the thread is waiting for a the next available
	workset in the pool.
</p>
<p>
	The reload functionality works both with the single threaded as well as the
	multi threaded modes. To try the reload functionality in single threaded
	mode build with FIFTYONEDEGREES_NO_THREADING defined. Or build without
	FIFTYONEDEGREES_NO_THREADING for multi threaded example.
</p>
<p>
	In a single threaded environment the reload function is executed as part of
	the normal flow of the program execution and will prevent any other actions
	until the reload is complete. The reload itself takes less than half a
	second even for Enterprise dataset. For more information see:
