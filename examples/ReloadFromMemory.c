<tutorial>
Reload from memory example that shows how to:
<ol>
	<li>Use the provider structure to access the pool, dataset and cache as
	well as device detection functionality.
	<li>Use the fiftyoneDegreesProviderReloadFromMemory function to reload the
	dataset, cache and workset pool from the data file that has been read into
	a continuous memory space.
	<li>Retrieve a workset from the pool and return it back into the pool when
	done with detecting current User-Agent.
	<li>Use the reload functionality in a single threaded environment.
	<li>Use the reload functionality in a multi threaded environment.
</ol>
<p>
	This example demonstrates how to use the 51Degrees provider structure to
	access the workset pool, cache and dataset as well as to invoke the reload
	functionality.
	<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
	static fiftyoneDegreesProvider provider;
	</pre></p>
</p>
<p>
	Example assumes that the initial pool, dataset and cache were created using
	either the fiftyoneDegreesInitProviderWithPropertyString function,
	or the fiftyoneDegreesInitProviderWithPropertyArray function.
</p>
<p>
	The fiftyoneDegreesProviderReloadFromMemory function requires an existing
	provider structure with initialized dataset, pool and cache. Function
	reloads the dataset from the provided pointer to the continuous memory
	space containing the data file. New dataset is created with the same
	parameters as the original dataset. New cache and pool are created.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Important</b>: unlike the reload from file example you need to decide if
	the 51Degrees API should dispose of the allocated file when the resources
	are deallocated or if you wish to retain the allocated memory for later
	use. To instruct the API to free the continuous memory space set the
	memoryToFree pointer equal to the pointer of the file in memory.
	<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
	fiftyoneDegreesDataSet *ds = (fiftyoneDegreesDataSet*)provider.activePool->dataSet;
	ds->memoryToFree = (void*)fileInMemory;
	</pre></p>
</p>
<p>
	Please keep in mind that even if the current dataset was constructed with
	all available properties this does not guarantee that the new dataset will
	be initialized with the same set of properties. If the new data file
	contains properties that were not part of the original data file, the new
	extra property(ies) will not be initialized. If the new data file does not
	contain one or more property that were previously available, then these
	property(ies) will not be initialized.
</p>
<p>
	Each successful data file reload should be accompanied by the integrity
	check to verify that the properties you want have indeed been loaded. This
	can be achieved by simply comparing the number of properties before and
	after the reload as the number can not go up but it can go down.
</p>
<p>
	Example also demonstrates the concept of a workset pool. A workset pool is
	a thread safe collection of workset structures. To retrieve a workset use:
	<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
	fiftyoneDegreesWorkset *ws = NULL;
	ws = fiftyoneDegreesProviderWorksetGet(&provider);
	</pre></p>
	And to return a workset to the pool use:
	<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
	fiftyoneDegreesWorksetRelease(ws);
	</pre></p>
</p>
<p>
	The benefit of the workset pool is that it eliminates the overheads of
	creating a new workset structure for every new request, instead an existing
	workset is used. Be sure to initialize the workset of the appropriate size
	as an insufficiently small workset could cause delay with processing the
	device detection requests as the thread is waiting for a the next available
	workset in the pool.
</p>
<p>
	The reload functionality works both with the single threaded as well as the
	multi threaded modes. To try the reload functionality in single threaded
	mode build with FIFTYONEDEGREES_NO_THREADING defined. Or build without
	FIFTYONEDEGREES_NO_THREADING for multi threaded example.
</p>
<p>
	In a single threaded environment the reload function is executed as part of
	the normal flow of the program execution and will prevent any other actions
	until the reload is complete. The reload itself takes less than half a
	second even for Enterprise dataset. For more information see:
	https://51degrees.com/Support/Documentation/APIs/C-V32/Benchmarks
